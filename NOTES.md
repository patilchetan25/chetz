# Clone Website – Asset Notes

## Hero Section Placeholders

- `assets/images/hero-chetz.png` should be a square portrait (ideally 512×512 or larger). It appears in both the central hero circle and outer orbit.
- `assets/images/me.png` powers the inner orbit photo; keep it square for best results.
- Remove or update the text in `.hero__note` and `.hero__stats` once final stats are ready.

## Upcoming Assets to Source

- `assets/images/bk.png` is the site-wide background image (full-screen). Replace with final artwork when ready.
- Project thumbnail images for the "Selected Work" grid.
- Logos or award icons for stats/testimonials sections (planned).

## Animation Hooks

- Keyframes `glow-pulse`, `float`, and `orbit` match the motion language of the hero area. Customize timings if the original assets require different pacing.
- When replacing images, ensure they include transparent/alpha variants where needed to preserve glow effects.

Update this note as new sections get implemented so final asset swaps are straightforward.***
