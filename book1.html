     <p>
      In a city that never pauses, Franklin and Emma cross paths beneath falling cherry blossoms — a moment too brief to mean anything, and too real to forget. Their story is still unfolding, somewhere between logic and longing.

            The first gust of New York air hit like static — cold, fast, alive. I tightened my grip on the suitcase handle and stared up at the glass towers splitting the sky. Every reflection was a reminder: this city eats noise and sells silence back at a markup.
           </p>
           <p>
            My watch buzzed. Another reminder — assignments, deadlines, promises made to myself. Work first. Always work first.
           </p>
           <p>
            Crossing 42nd, I stopped when I saw it — a massive LED screen showing a Korean drama. The actors stood in the rain, arguing about love like it was a science. I wanted to laugh, but the way he looked at her made me stop. It was staged, sure, but not fake. For a second, it felt like the world slowed just enough to listen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The wind shifted, carrying the smell of roasted chestnuts and exhaust. Cherry blossoms, half-bloomed, swayed at the edge of Bryant Park, trying to survive the city’s impatience. A petal landed on my sleeve, and I watched it stick there, weightless but stubborn. For some reason, I didn’t brush it off.
           </p>
           <p>
            My head said keep moving. My chest said wait. I stayed long enough to feel both.
           </p>
           <p>
            The screen flickered; the scene changed. I turned away and kept walking.
           </p>

            The hospital smelled like antiseptic and burnt coffee. I’d learned to stop noticing. I changed into my sneakers by the lockers, tied the laces tight, double-knotted — the small rituals that pretended to give control.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the time I got outside, the air had softened. The evening light was pale gold, too gentle for the city’s tempo. I walked without a destination, just following the streets like they might know something I didn’t.
           </p>
           <p>
            Passing a storefront window, I saw my reflection layered over a television playing the same Korean drama I’d been watching last night. The same couple in the rain. The same line that always caught me — “If we’re going to break, let’s break beautifully.”
           </p>
           <p>
            I smiled, embarrassed. Romantic nonsense. Still, I lingered. The actress tilted her face up toward the rain, eyes wide, waiting for something that wouldn’t come. I knew that look. I’d worn it before.
           </p>
           <p>
            A soft drift of pink filled the edge of my vision — cherry blossoms, carried by the wind from the square down the street. I followed them, like an idiot chasing paper wishes. When I reached the park, petals spun in circles, too many to count. They clung to hair, to sleeves, to the air itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            A man stood under one of the trees — gray hoodie, still, looking up. His face caught a strip of sunlight and went quiet. I didn’t know him, but something about the way he stood — like he’d just remembered something important — made me stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            I told myself it was nothing. Just a stranger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, I stayed until he moved.

           <p>
            The wind picked up. Blossoms fell harder, soft collisions against my hoodie. The city kept going — horns, laughter, a siren two blocks away — but this small square felt like it had its own clock.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked up through the branches, and across the square, I saw her — standing by the bench, hair brushed by wind, watching the same trees I was. Our eyes met for maybe a breath, maybe less. Not enough to mean anything. But somehow, it did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked away first. Habit, maybe. Or fear of believing in coincidences.
           </p>
           <p>
            The petal on my sleeve fluttered once and fell. I watched it spiral to the ground, land perfectly still, and thought — okay. Fine. You win.
           </p>

           <p>
            He walked away first. I didn’t move, not right away. Just watched the spot he’d been standing, the space that still seemed to hold him.
           </p>
           <p>
            A breeze passed through, gentle this time, brushing blossoms past my shoulder. The petals stuck to my sleeve like punctuation. I didn’t shake them off.
           </p>
           <p>
            The city roared back to life — a bus braking, someone laughing too loudly, a dog barking at nothing. I exhaled, checked the time, and told myself to go. But part of me — a quiet, stubborn part — wanted to stay and see if he’d turn around.
           </p>
           <p>
            He didn’t.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, the air felt different after that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that night, when I finally got home, the first thing I noticed wasn’t the mess of textbooks or my ringing phone — it was a single pink petal stuck to the cuff of my sleeve.

        Today wakes up wrong. The alarm is a mosquito in my ear; the room is colder than the thermostat swears. I make black coffee strong enough to argue back. Sip. Burn. Fine. Jeans, hoodie, backpack. The mirror says: you look awake enough to pass.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the sidewalk the city is a conveyor belt. I step on, let it carry me. I tell myself yesterday was nothing—wind, blossoms, a face I won’t see again. My chest doesn’t buy it. I keep walking until the thought loses volume.
       </p>
       <p>
        Campus hums. In lecture, numbers line up like soldiers and then desert under the professor’s marker. I copy them anyway. When class empties, I’m already moving toward break like it’s the next assignment.

        The dining hall is a low sky of chatter and clatter. Steam ghosts the glass above a row of trays. Sunlight throws a bright rectangle across the middle tables; students compete for the warmth without admitting it.

        FRANKLIN — BREAK

       <p>
        Jose gets there first, drops a tray down like he’s docking a ship. “What are we eating?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Something that qualifies as food,” I say. I scan the options: noodles that look reflective, a heroic salad, pizza that believes in itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Friday,” Jose says, as if it’s a menu item. “Hoboken. Party. You in?”
       </p>
       <p>
        I push my tray along the rail. “Maybe.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Maybe is a no wearing a hat,” he says. “Wear a yes.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary slides into the seat across from me with the grace of someone who refuses to apologize for existing loudly. “We’re not doing salad today,” she announces. “We’re doing carbs that can be legally classified as a hug.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Carb hugs,” Jose echoes. “The only real love.”
       </p>
       <p>
        I end up with a bowl of noodles and a banana that looks optimistic. The seat next to Mary fills with someone I haven’t seen before—Elizabeth. She brings the crisp, attentive quiet of people who read instructions and still improvise.

        She notices Franklin in pieces: the almost-grown-out hair that can’t decide between black and brown, the hoodie sleeves pushed to mid-forearm, the way his eyes track a conversation like a math problem and then warm when it lands. His skin catches the sun and keeps it. Nothing flashy, but something steady. She files the data without deciding what to do with it.

        “So,” she says lightly, twirling a fork, “do you believe in fateful encounters, or do you prefer your life strictly scheduled?”
       </p>
       <p>
        I look up from the noodles. The question hits a nerve I pretend doesn’t exist. “I prefer my trains on time,” I say. “Everything else is negotiable.”
       </p>

        She smiles like she’s testing glassware for a hairline crack. “Trains are romantic too. Two lines crossing for a second and then—gone.”

        Jose points at the pizza slice. “This is fate. I didn’t choose it; it chose me.”

        Mary rolls her eyes. “It chose your arteries.”
       </p>
       <p>
        They keep the banter alive. I keep hearing the word crossing. Blossoms drop in my memory like static. A face under branches. I don’t say any of it. I eat my noodles, which taste both better and worse because I’m thinking about something else.

        Jose elbows me. “Friday?”

        I start the day with espresso, the kind that tastes like it knows your secrets. The machine growls; I growl back. Sneakers on, hair up, badge clipped. The mirror says my eyes didn’t sleep enough. True.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the hospital, fluorescent lights crown everything with a tired halo. “Morning,” Molly says, pinning her hair. Her smile is a blanket you can borrow for a minute.
       </p>
       <p>
        “How’s your day going so far?” she asks.

        She grins. “We’ll intercept the next memo.”

       <p>
        Mason appears with a tablet and a non-negotiable coffee he sets by my elbow. “Weekend intel,” he says. “What did you do?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Nothing much,” I say, then add, because my mouth runs on its own sometimes, “Just… holding to the beta.”

        He lifts an eyebrow. “Mysterious.”

        “Staring is a valid protocol,” he says solemnly, then winks.

        Rounds blur into notes and nods. Time moves in hospital minutes: long and fast at once. At lunch, I manage three bites of something with chickpeas and regret. At four, the day loosens its grip by an inch.

        The word clicks against yesterday in my head: branches, wind, a stranger under pink weather. I don’t say it out loud. I don’t need to. The feeling is enough: a small door opening in a wall I didn’t realize I’d built.

        Jose and Mary get snagged by errands and the undertow of group work. I bail early, not because I’m efficient (I am) but because I want the hush of a half-empty train to reorder my thoughts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The station swallows footsteps and feeds them back as echoes. I tap my card, descend into tile and dust and that wind the tunnel makes when no train is there yet. I change at 34th. I ride one stop too far on purpose just to see if the pattern breaks. It doesn’t. I aim myself at 7th Avenue because the map says it’s sensible.

       </p>
       <p>
        The platform splits in two—one for uptown, one for downtown. We choose our side. The other platform holds strangers I’m not supposed to study, but I can’t help scanning faces the way I scan charts: looking for patterns, for what doesn’t match. A train arrives on the far side, all light and noise and possibility disguised as steel.

CHAPTER 3- WHAT THE FCK

Jose’s horn always sounds ruder than it needs to.

I was still fixing my collar in the mirror when I heard it—one short, impatient beep that basically said, “I’m here, move your ass.”  
I looked at myself one last time: black turtleneck, black jeans, long trench coat. I looked way more put-together than I felt.

I grabbed my phone, slid on my shoes, and headed out.

Through the window I’d already seen him: Jose, leaning on his car like a discount music-video extra.

Before I even reached the car, he lifted his chin and said,

“Bro, you’re driving today.”

I stopped.  
“…What?”

“You’re driving,” he repeated, like he was asking me to pass the remote.

I stared at him.  
“Jose… my guy… my oxygen… what part of your brain forgot that I don’t know how to drive?”

He shrugged.  
“That’s why you should start.”

I blinked.  
“That’s like saying, ‘I don’t know how to swim, so throw me in the ocean, maybe I’ll learn before I die.’”

He laughed, but he was still holding the keys out.

“I’m being serious, Franklin. What if one day you HAVE to drive and nobody is there? What will you do then?”

“There it is,” I said. “The hypothetical bullshit.”

He squinted. “It’s not bullshit, it’s real life planning.”

“Real life planning?” I repeated. “Okay, Mr. Future Scenario. What’s next? ‘Franklin, what if the world is ending and the only way to survive is if you reverse park between two meteors?’”

Jose burst out laughing, bending over, hand on his stomach.

“You’re so fcking stupid, bro.”

“And yet,” I said, walking around to the passenger side, trench coat moving a little with the wind, “I will not be driving.”

He sighed like I was the failure of his bloodline, but he still got into the driver’s seat.

“You’re gonna regret this one day when you need to escape a zombie apocalypse in a Honda Civic.”

“If zombies come, I’m dying in the living room,” I said. “I’m not fighting for a world that still has 8 AM classes.”

He shook his head, started the car, and we pulled off.

The evening felt nice—that in-between time where it’s not dark yet, but the sky is thinking about it. His usual playlist was on, the same songs we’ve heard so many times they’re basically part of our friendship now.

“We’re picking up Mary first,” he said, tapping the steering wheel in time with the beat.

“Of course we are,” I replied. “How is Queen Mary doing?”

“Better than your love life,” he shot back.

“Everybody’s love life is better than mine,” I said. “That’s not a flex.”

He smirked, but his face softened a bit when we turned into her street. We’d been there a hundred times—same row of houses, same half-broken mailbox at the corner, same warm porch lights.

He slowed down in front of her place.

“There she is,” he said, voice just a little softer.

Mary walked out in a simple top and jeans, hair slightly curled at the ends, phone in her hand, that small smile she always gave when she saw us.

I leaned back in my seat and muttered, just loud enough for him to hear, “Look at you… nervous like it’s your first date again.”

“Shut up,” he said, but he was smiling.

Mary opened the back door and slid in.

“Hi Franklin,” she said, warm as always.

“Hey Mary,” I turned slightly. “Ready to babysit your two idiots for the night?”

She laughed. “I’ve accepted this as my part-time job.”

Jose glanced at her in the rearview mirror, eyes soft in a way he’d deny if I ever mentioned it.

“You good?” he asked.

“Yeah,” she nodded. “Let’s go.”

Jose pulled away from the curb, and with the three of us in the car and the city opening up in front of us, the night finally started to feel real.

––––––––

The apartment was already loud before we stepped in.

Music, laughter, that low bass you feel in your chest. LED lights around the ceiling, switching colors like the room couldn’t pick a mood.

We barely got through the door before I heard:

“Franklin! Jose! You guys finally made it!”

Elizabeth came toward us with a half-hug, half-jump greeting. Hair up, earrings on, little bit of makeup, same chaotic energy.

“Damn, Liz upgraded the place,” I said, looking around. “Last time I was here there were three chairs and depression.”

She laughed, shoving my shoulder. “Shut up. Midterms are over. We’re allowed to act alive again.”

People kept drifting over—quick “hi,” “where you been,” “nice coat,” “Mary, you look so cute”—the usual pre-party small talk.

Somehow I ended up in the middle of a small circle, just talking nonsense and making jokes. I don’t even remember how it started, but suddenly everything I said had people laughing.

One guy was ranting about his professor.

I said, “If attendance is 20% of the grade, I should get emotional attendance points for all the times I thought about going.”

They laughed.

Someone else said they were “taking a break from dating.”

I said, “Same. I’m in a committed relationship with confusion right now.”

They laughed harder.

For a second, it felt easy. Like maybe I wasn’t the quiet one. Like maybe I actually belonged in the moment.

Then someone yelled from the kitchen:

“SHOTSSSS GAME!”

Jose immediately lit up. “Oh yeah, I’ve trained my whole life for this.”

Mary rolled her eyes. “You’re drinking water between, right?”

“Yes, coach,” he said, kissing the air.

Everyone crowded around the kitchen island. Plastic shot glasses. Cheap tequila. Lime wedges that already looked tired.

The music went up. People started dancing, yelling lyrics, voices layered over the bass.

I took a shot. Then another. Then someone handed me a cup without explanation.

Cold. Fizzy. Sweet.

I leaned back against the wall, sipping it slowly, watching everything:

Jose dancing like he was auditioning for a meme,  
Mary laughing at him,  
Elizabeth hyping everyone up.

And in the middle of all the noise, this thought slid into my head:

Look how happy everybody is.

Just music, friends, alcohol, dumb jokes.

I caught myself thinking:

If people can feel this happy with just this…  
why do they need anyone?

Why do we all keep chasing “our person” if nights like this exist?

Why do we talk like we’re incomplete if we can just… be here, loud and stupid and not-lonely?

I took another sip.

That’s when Elizabeth’s voice cut through my spiral.

“Hey,” she said, stepping in front of me slightly, eyes on my cup. “Do you know what you’re drinking?”

I shrugged. “Soft drink?”

She lifted one eyebrow. “You fool,” she said. “That’s the weed drink. THC. It’s infused.”

I blinked. Once. Twice.

“…Ah,” I said. “So that’s why my brain is trying to write a philosophy textbook right now.”

She laughed. “Yeah, that’s not soda, professor. That’s the think-about-your-life special.”

“Fck,” I muttered, staring at the cup like it betrayed me. “That explains a lot.”

Suddenly it all made sense—why my thoughts were moving in slow motion but also in ten directions, why the happiness in the room felt too sharp, why every feeling had a neon sign above it.

I knew myself. If I started really talking like this, things would come out too honest, too dark, or just too complicated.

So I put the cup down on the counter and told myself:

Control it.  
Stay on the surface.  
Do not open the door in your head.

“You good?” Elizabeth asked, still searching my face.

“Yeah,” I forced a small smile. “I just accidentally subscribed to the premium thought package, that’s all.”

She laughed and shook her head. “You’ll be fine. Just don’t chug it.”

“Noted,” I said. “No more soul juice.”

Someone called her name from across the room and she waved, drifting back into the crowd.

I stayed there for a second, watching everyone dance—bodies moving, lights flickering, voices melting into the music.

Outside, I probably looked normal. Just another guy leaning against a wall at a party.

Inside, I was holding my thoughts with both hands, trying not to spill.

And still, under all the noise, a quiet voice in my head whispered:

You’re happy… right?  
So why does it still feel like something’s missing?

I let the music get louder.

I pushed the thought down.

And I stepped back toward the group, choosing laughter over whatever my brain was trying to do tonight.

––––––––

I don’t know how long I drifted like that—floating between people, half in my head, half in the room.

At some point, things slowed down; the music shifted into softer tracks, the room got a little hazier. Jose and some guy were debating soccer like it was politics. Mary was chatting with a girl about something on her nails. I was parked in a corner again, just… existing.

Then I saw Elizabeth by the kitchen doorway.

This time she wasn’t hyping people up or laughing. Her shoulders were slightly hunched, eyes shiny, and she was wiping at her face like she didn’t want anyone to notice.

The THC in my system made her sadness feel louder somehow.

I walked over.

“Hey,” I said quietly. “You alright?”

She glanced up, tried to pull a smile that didn’t really land.

“I’m fine,” she said.

Which always means no.

Before I could say more, Mary appeared beside us like she’d been tracking the shift in the air.

“What happened?” Mary asked gently, already resting a hand on Elizabeth’s arm.

Elizabeth let out a breath that shook a little.

“It’s nothing, I’m just… being stupid.”

“You’re not stupid,” Mary said immediately. “You’re allowed to feel things.”

That was enough to crack whatever she’d been holding in.

She laughed once, softly, but it was the sad kind.

“You know,” she started, eyes glassy, “I had a really good relationship. Actually good. No cheating, no screaming, no big drama. We had fun. We laughed a lot. Everything felt… right.”

I stayed quiet, letting her talk.

“And then one day he just said he wanted to end things,” she went on. “He wasn’t angry. He wasn’t cruel. He was just… calm. Like he’d already made peace with leaving before he even said it. He ended it in this cool, happy way, like it was just… an update.”

Her gaze dropped to the floor.

“And I didn’t say anything,” she said. “I had a million things I wanted to say but I just… didn’t. Because once someone decides they don’t want you anymore, sometimes that decision alone is enough to let them go. What are you supposed to do? Beg them to stay?”

Mary’s expression softened deeply.

“Yeah,” Mary said quietly. “Sometimes that’s exactly how it feels. Like they’re already gone before you even understand what’s happening.”

I swallowed.

The way Elizabeth said “the decision is enough to let them go” sat weirdly heavy in my chest.

Maybe it was the drink.  
Maybe the night.  
Maybe just the way it sounded too familiar.

I didn’t know what to add without making it worse, so I grabbed the easiest thing my brain could reach.

“Everything is destiny, I guess,” I said. “Some people stay, some people leave. Maybe it’s all just… written.”

Mary turned and gave me this cold little glare—not full anger, just a sharp look that said:

You don’t really get it.

And she was right.

I understood what she meant without her saying a word.

I don’t know how to make a girl feel better.  
I don’t know the right words.  
I say “destiny” because it’s easier than admitting I don’t understand why good things end.

Mary turned back to Elizabeth.

“Sometimes it just… sucks,” she said. “There isn’t always a reason that makes sense.”

Elizabeth sniffed, nodded. “Yeah. It just hurts. Even when you know you should move on.”

Mary squeezed her shoulder.

“Come on,” Mary said after a moment. “Let’s not sit in this all night. You wanna do something stupid and distracting?”

Elizabeth blinked, then gave a small tired smile. “Like what?”

Mary glanced at me. “Basement. We’ll play something. It’ll help.”

A little later, a bunch of us headed downstairs. The basement had low ceilings, a sagging couch, and a foldable table. It looked exactly like the kind of place where questionable decisions but good memories are made.

“Let’s play Mafia,” someone suggested, and the room instantly woke up.

Mafia is that game where everyone sits in a circle, secretly gets roles like mafia or villager, then argues and lies to figure out who’s who. People accuse, defend, fake-cry, and pretend they’re innocent even when they’re not.

“Okay, everyone sit in a circle!” Elizabeth called, voice brighter now, like she was borrowing some happiness back.

Jose rubbed his hands together. “Oh yeah, I’m built for this. I was born to lie.”

Mary sat between us, already smiling more than before. I took a spot across from Elizabeth.

Cards were dealt. Eyes closed. “Night falls.”

People started accusing each other, pretending they were “100% sure,” acting offended, defending themselves with Oscar-level performances.

“Franklin is too quiet, he’s definitely mafia,” Jose said.

“I’m quiet in real life, dumbass,” I replied. “That’s my default setting.”

Everyone laughed.

Mary dramatically defended me at one point. Elizabeth falsely accused Jose. Jose gasped like he’d been betrayed by his own blood.

We played round after round—people “dying,” coming back as narrators, overacting every reveal.

And for a while, the tears, the THC, the confusion, all blurred into loud, stupid, warm laughter in that small basement.

We were just college kids again.

Nothing in life got solved.  
Nobody got their ex back.  
Nobody fixed their future.

But for that stretch of time, it was enough.

––––––––

Sunday morning felt like the world had turned the volume down.

We were at the park—me, Jose, and Mary—walking slow, coffees in hand, letting the cool air clear whatever was left in our systems from the night before.

Jose was still talking about Mafia like it was a real crime case. “I’m telling you, Mary, Franklin was suspicious.”

“I was literally innocent the whole time,” I said. “You’re just bad at reading people.”

“Or you’re too good at lying,” he shot back.

Mary just shook her head, smiling.

We followed the path until it opened into a wider patch of grass. Trees scattered, kids running around, dogs chasing nothing, couples sitting on blankets.

That’s when I saw her.

Under one of the trees, a little away from everyone, there was a girl sitting on a small blanket with a canvas in front of her. Head slightly tilted, hair falling forward, brush in hand.

She was painting.  
Calm. Focused.  
Completely in her own world.

Something about that scene felt still, like the whole park was moving except that spot.

I kept looking without really meaning to.

Then, from just behind me, Mary’s voice came out, a little surprised:

“Wait… that face looks familiar. I think that’s my friend Emma.”

My brain glitched.

What.  
The.  
Fck.

And everything stopped right there.
