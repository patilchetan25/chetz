     </h1>
     <p>
      In a city that never pauses, Franklin and Emma cross paths beneath falling cherry blossoms — a moment too brief to mean anything, and too real to forget. Their story is still unfolding, somewhere between logic and longing.

            The first gust of New York air hit like static — cold, fast, alive. I tightened my grip on the suitcase handle and stared up at the glass towers splitting the sky. Every reflection was a reminder: this city eats noise and sells silence back at a markup.
           </p>
           <p>
            My watch buzzed. Another reminder — assignments, deadlines, promises made to myself. Work first. Always work first.
           </p>
           <p>
            Crossing 42nd, I stopped when I saw it — a massive LED screen showing a Korean drama. The actors stood in the rain, arguing about love like it was a science. I wanted to laugh, but the way he looked at her made me stop. It was staged, sure, but not fake. For a second, it felt like the world slowed just enough to listen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The wind shifted, carrying the smell of roasted chestnuts and exhaust. Cherry blossoms, half-bloomed, swayed at the edge of Bryant Park, trying to survive the city’s impatience. A petal landed on my sleeve, and I watched it stick there, weightless but stubborn. For some reason, I didn’t brush it off.
           </p>
           <p>
            My head said keep moving. My chest said wait. I stayed long enough to feel both.
           </p>
           <p>
            The screen flickered; the scene changed. I turned away and kept walking.
           </p>

            The hospital smelled like antiseptic and burnt coffee. I’d learned to stop noticing. I changed into my sneakers by the lockers, tied the laces tight, double-knotted — the small rituals that pretended to give control.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the time I got outside, the air had softened. The evening light was pale gold, too gentle for the city’s tempo. I walked without a destination, just following the streets like they might know something I didn’t.
           </p>
           <p>
            Passing a storefront window, I saw my reflection layered over a television playing the same Korean drama I’d been watching last night. The same couple in the rain. The same line that always caught me — “If we’re going to break, let’s break beautifully.”
           </p>
           <p>
            I smiled, embarrassed. Romantic nonsense. Still, I lingered. The actress tilted her face up toward the rain, eyes wide, waiting for something that wouldn’t come. I knew that look. I’d worn it before.
           </p>
           <p>
            A soft drift of pink filled the edge of my vision — cherry blossoms, carried by the wind from the square down the street. I followed them, like an idiot chasing paper wishes. When I reached the park, petals spun in circles, too many to count. They clung to hair, to sleeves, to the air itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            A man stood under one of the trees — gray hoodie, still, looking up. His face caught a strip of sunlight and went quiet. I didn’t know him, but something about the way he stood — like he’d just remembered something important — made me stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            I told myself it was nothing. Just a stranger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, I stayed until he moved.

            The wind picked up. Blossoms fell harder, soft collisions against my hoodie. The city kept going — horns, laughter, a siren two blocks away — but this small square felt like it had its own clock.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked up through the branches, and across the square, I saw her — standing by the bench, hair brushed by wind, watching the same trees I was. Our eyes met for maybe a breath, maybe less. Not enough to mean anything. But somehow, it did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked away first. Habit, maybe. Or fear of believing in coincidences.
           </p>
           <p>
            The petal on my sleeve fluttered once and fell. I watched it spiral to the ground, land perfectly still, and thought — okay. Fine. You win.
           </p>

           <p>
            He walked away first. I didn’t move, not right away. Just watched the spot he’d been standing, the space that still seemed to hold him.
           </p>
           <p>
            A breeze passed through, gentle this time, brushing blossoms past my shoulder. The petals stuck to my sleeve like punctuation. I didn’t shake them off.
           </p>
           <p>
            The city roared back to life — a bus braking, someone laughing too loudly, a dog barking at nothing. I exhaled, checked the time, and told myself to go. But part of me — a quiet, stubborn part — wanted to stay and see if he’d turn around.
           </p>
           <p>
            He didn’t.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, the air felt different after that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that night, when I finally got home, the first thing I noticed wasn’t the mess of textbooks or my ringing phone — it was a single pink petal stuck to the cuff of my sleeve.

        Today wakes up wrong. The alarm is a mosquito in my ear; the room is colder than the thermostat swears. I make black coffee strong enough to argue back. Sip. Burn. Fine. Jeans, hoodie, backpack. The mirror says: you look awake enough to pass.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the sidewalk the city is a conveyor belt. I step on, let it carry me. I tell myself yesterday was nothing—wind, blossoms, a face I won’t see again. My chest doesn’t buy it. I keep walking until the thought loses volume.
       </p>
       <p>
        Campus hums. In lecture, numbers line up like soldiers and then desert under the professor’s marker. I copy them anyway. When class empties, I’m already moving toward break like it’s the next assignment.

       </p>
       <p>
        “Something that qualifies as food,” I say. I scan the options: noodles that look reflective, a heroic salad, pizza that believes in itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Friday,” Jose says, as if it’s a menu item. “Hoboken. Party. You in?”
       </p>
       <p>
        I push my tray along the rail. “Maybe.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Maybe is a no wearing a hat,” he says. “Wear a yes.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary slides into the seat across from me with the grace of someone who refuses to apologize for existing loudly. “We’re not doing salad today,” she announces. “We’re doing carbs that can be legally classified as a hug.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Carb hugs,” Jose echoes. “The only real love.”
       </p>
       <p>
        I end up with a bowl of noodles and a banana that looks optimistic. The seat next to Mary fills with someone I haven’t seen before—Elizabeth. She brings the crisp, attentive quiet of people who read instructions and still improvise.

        She notices Franklin in pieces: the almost-grown-out hair that can’t decide between black and brown, the hoodie sleeves pushed to mid-forearm, the way his eyes track a conversation like a math problem and then warm when it lands. His skin catches the sun and keeps it. Nothing flashy, but something steady. She files the data without deciding what to do with it.

        “So,” she says lightly, twirling a fork, “do you believe in fateful encounters, or do you prefer your life strictly scheduled?”
       </p>
       <p>
        I look up from the noodles. The question hits a nerve I pretend doesn’t exist. “I prefer my trains on time,” I say. “Everything else is negotiable.”
       </p>
       <p>
        She smiles like she’s testing glassware for a hairline crack. “Trains are romantic too. Two lines crossing for a second and then—gone.”

        Jose points at the pizza slice. “This is fate. I didn’t choose it; it chose me.”

        Mary rolls her eyes. “It chose your arteries.”
       </p>

        They keep the banter alive. I keep hearing the word crossing. Blossoms drop in my memory like static. A face under branches. I don’t say any of it. I eat my noodles, which taste both better and worse because I’m thinking about something else.

       <p>
        Jose elbows me. “Friday?”

        I start the day with espresso, the kind that tastes like it knows your secrets. The machine growls; I growl back. Sneakers on, hair up, badge clipped. The mirror says my eyes didn’t sleep enough. True.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the hospital, fluorescent lights crown everything with a tired halo. “Morning,” Molly says, pinning her hair. Her smile is a blanket you can borrow for a minute.
       </p>
       <p>
        “How’s your day going so far?” she asks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I blow out a breath. “Shitty,” I say. “Like the universe sent a memo and forgot to cc: me.”

        She grins. “We’ll intercept the next memo.”

        Mason appears with a tablet and a non-negotiable coffee he sets by my elbow. “Weekend intel,” he says. “What did you do?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Nothing much,” I say, then add, because my mouth runs on its own sometimes, “Just… holding to the beta.”
       </p>
       <p>
        He lifts an eyebrow. “Mysterious.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Meaning,” I say, “I tested the new study app until my eyes resigned. And I stared out the window more than I’ll admit.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Staring is a valid protocol,” he says solemnly, then winks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rounds blur into notes and nods. Time moves in hospital minutes: long and fast at once. At lunch, I manage three bites of something with chickpeas and regret. At four, the day loosens its grip by an inch.

        The sign is theatrical; the awning is a promise. Inside, everything glows like it was told to behave for photographs. We claim a small table with a view of specials written in confident chalk. The famous frozen thing arrives looking like a dare.

        Molly spoons sugar into her coffee like she’s dealing cards. “Do you know what ‘serendipity’ actually means?” she asks.

        The word clicks against yesterday in my head: branches, wind, a stranger under pink weather. I don’t say it out loud. I don’t need to. The feeling is enough: a small door opening in a wall I didn’t realize I’d built.
       </p>
       <p>
        Molly watches me but lets the silence be friendly. “To beneficial chance,” she says, lifting her cup.

        Jose and Mary get snagged by errands and the undertow of group work. I bail early, not because I’m efficient (I am) but because I want the hush of a half-empty train to reorder my thoughts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The station swallows footsteps and feeds them back as echoes. I tap my card, descend into tile and dust and that wind the tunnel makes when no train is there yet. I change at 34th. I ride one stop too far on purpose just to see if the pattern breaks. It doesn’t. I aim myself at 7th Avenue because the map says it’s sensible.

        We leave the café full of sugar and better jokes. The station is a few blocks; the air has that end-of-day tilt. On the stairs down, Mason tells a story about a patient who named her IV pole “Gerald.” I laugh too loud; it feels good to hear myself laugh.
       </p>

        The platform splits in two—one for uptown, one for downtown. We choose our side. The other platform holds strangers I’m not supposed to study, but I can’t help scanning faces the way I scan charts: looking for patterns, for what doesn’t match. A train arrives on the far side, all light and noise and possibility disguised as steel.

        Across the tracks, a group leans into a conversation only they can hear. A girl in a light coat turns her head like the air spoke to her. For a beat, the sound drops out of the station. I think I recognize the angle of her face more than the face itself.
       </p>

        My train rolls in from the left, hers from the right. For a heartbeat our windows overlap—carriage to carriage, frame to frame—two films projected across each other. I raise my eyes. She raises hers.
