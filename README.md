# We Fell Like Petals · Portfolio Clone

A single-page portfolio inspired by Patrick David’s brutalist aesthetic, rebuilt with bespoke hero typography, immersive storytelling, and a modal reader for fiction chapters.

## Features

- **Hero headline animation** – each letter of “SOFTWARE ENGINEER” drifts into place with a cinematic landing.
- **Follow CTA** – quick links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram.
- **Writer hub** – “We Fell Like Petals” showcases an immersive reader for Chapter 01 and placeholders for future chapters.
- **Responsive layout** – fluid grid, glassmorphism accents, and blur transitions across desktop and mobile.
